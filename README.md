# Magic Paper

By Michael Nielsen, October 2017.

Written to target Chrome 62 on OS X Sierra. Not tested at all on other
browsers.

This is code for a research prototype, created to answer questions and
explore ideas. It's buggy, poorly structured, contains numerous
kludges, and misses lots of edge cases.

I currently have no interest in fixing any of these problems, or in
expanding it. With all those warnings, if you still want to play with
the code, go for it.
