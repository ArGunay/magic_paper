# Magic Paper

By Michael Nielsen, October 2017. Written to accompany
on [a short essay about Magic Paper](http://cognitivemedium.com/magic_paper/index.html).

Written to target Chrome 62 on OS X Sierra. Not tested at all on other
browsers.

This is code for a research prototype, created to answer questions and
explore ideas. It's buggy, poorly structured, contains numerous
kludges, and misses lots of edge cases.

I currently have no interest in fixing any of these problems, or in
expanding it. Given that, issues and pull requests will be closed.
With all those warnings, if you still want to play with the code, go
for it.
